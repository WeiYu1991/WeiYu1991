## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  
In chinese, as the saying goes, Teacher is a diligent gardener.  
Currently, I'm a gardener working on Shenzhen Longgang NO.2 Vocational School.  
I often tell my students:  
Have responsibilities,  
Have dreams and hope,  
Fight for ourselves,  
Fight for families,  
Fight for friends,  
Enjoy now,  
Imagine the future.
